  abstract               = {The purpose of this research was to design and develop hydrogels by esterification of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with gelatin. The membranes were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction (XRD), and differential scanning calorimetry. The viscosity of the esterified product (as solution) was compared with the mixture of PVA and gelatin of the same composition. The mechanical properties of the hydrogels were characterized by tensile tests. Swelling behavior and hemocompatibility of the membrane were also evaluated. The diffusion coefficient of salicylic acid (SA), when the receptor compartment contained Ringer's solution, through the membrane was determined. SA was used as a model drug. FTIR spectra of the membranes indicated complete esterification of the free carboxylic groups of gelatin. XRD studies indicated that the crystallinity of the membranes was mainly due to gelatin. The comparison of viscosity indicated an increase in segment density within the molecular coil. The membrane had sufficient strength and water-holding capacity. Hemocompatibility suggested that the hydrogel could be tried as wound dressing and as an implantable drug delivery system. The diffusion coefficient of SA through the membrane was found to be 1.32 x 10(-5) cm(2)/s. The experimental results indicated that the hydrogel could be tried for various biomedical applications.},

  abstract = {This paper reports a study on the influence of the renaturation level of gelatin on the mechanical and swelling properties of gelatin films. Films at different renaturation level were obtained from gelatin samples with different Bloom index. It was verified that the triple-helix content, calculated from the values of the enthalpy of denaturation associated to the endothermal transition at about 41°C of gelatin, increases with the Bloom index. The d.s.c. data are further supported by the results of the X-ray diffraction investigation carried out on the same samples. The increase of triple-helix content provokes a significant reduction in the degree of swelling, and a remarkable improvement of the mechanical properties of the films. The elastic Young's modulus, E, increases linearly with the renaturation level, from 3.6 to 12.0MPa. Crosslinking with GTA 1% remarkably reduces the degree of swelling of all the samples, and induces a further increase of the Young's modulus, which reaches values up to 27MPa.},
