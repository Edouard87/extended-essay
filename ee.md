# Introduction

A polymer is a large molecule composed of smaller building blocks, called monomers, linked together to form long chains \cite[p.~10]{Herdman1993} Polymers can be produced by artificial means, as is the case with **polyethylene** and **nylon**, among many others. These polymers, which are frequently referred to as plastics, can be molded or shaped by the application of heat or pressure. In addition, they also tend to have several other useful capabilities, such as a low density, a low electrical conductivity, transparency, and considerable toughness. \cite{Rodriguez2020} By virtue of these properties, man-made plastics have had a dramatic impact on the daily lives of many, and are a component in many products. \cite{Rodriguez2020, Herdman1993} As an example of their incredible versatility, plastics can be found in the composition of automobile interiors as well as many different types of clothing and beverage containers. \par

That said, such synthetic polymers have been subject of considerable criticism due to the fact that they are not biodegradable and are derived from nonrenewable resources. \cite[p.~2]{Herdman1993} In fact, the great strength and toughness of these plastics, a characteristic that is considered advantageous by the industry, causes them to persist in the environment and makes their disposal rather complex \cite[p.~2]{Herdman1993} Many synthetic plastics produce toxic byproducts upon their production and make use of toxic ingredients, making their production dangerous for natural life. \cite[p.~2]{Herdman1993} \par

Some historians consider that plastics began with the synthesis of Bakelite in 1907. \cite{Moore2020} Although this perhaps marked the beginning of the age of synthetic plastics, humans have made use of *natural* polymers for thousands of years. \cite[p.~1]{Herdman1993} Natural polymers, for instance, include DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), a substance used by most organisms on planet Earth to transmit genetic information, and collagen. \cite[p.~7]{Herdman1993} In light of the many disadvantages of synthetic polymers, these natural polymers have been considered as a possible replacement by virtue of their ability to effectively naturally biodegrade. One such biopolymer is collagen \cite[p.~2]{Herdman1993}. \par

Collagen is a major structural protein of most connective tissues in mammals, such as skin, bones, and tendons. \cite{Ramachandran1963} Collagen-based plastic is already used in the production of drug-delivery devices (i.e. pill capsules), though its application in the context of other fields such as packaging has been criticized due to its structural weakness. Thus, this essay aims to determine whether an  an increase in the gelatin content of a sample of  bioplastic can offer a considerable increase in the mechanical strength of the sample. If this relationship is indeed true, gelatin bioplastics may have the potential to replace traditional plastics.

Research has already been conducted in the strength of gelatin bioplastic, such as \cite{Pal2007}. That said, this research used different gelatin samples with known triple-helix concentrations. The idea was to characterize the properties of these different samples. It was concluded that samples with a greater triple-helix content were stronger. That said, can the properties of greater triple-helix collagen be recreated by simply increasing the collagen concentration? 

# Investigation

This lab is composed of three parts. Part 1 is the creation of the samples, part 2 is weighing the samples after they have been created and placing them in water, and part 3 is weighing the samples after they have been soaking in water for several hours.

This means that there are two weights for the samples; the weights before being placed in the water, called the *wet weight*, and the weights after having been placed in the water, called the *dry weight*.

The procedure involved 4 sets of six samples, in order to have the ability to accurately calculate the
